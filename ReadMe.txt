This my first experiment in making a web page of my own.

This site hold three pages:

Page-1 shows my profile picture, and about my university and contains videos related to the university.

Page-2 is basically a type of application that calculates age of a person by reading the Date of Birth and results it in the form of Days, Hours and Minutes.

page-3 provides link to my profiles on Linked-in, GitHub and BitBucket and also asks for the person viewing my site for their contact details.




I have used the Twitter-Bootstrap for my framework, which I have downloaded it from the Initialzr.com web site.

I referred the below mentioned website for breaking the logic to calculate Hours, minutes and days in my App.
